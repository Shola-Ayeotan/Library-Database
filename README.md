# Library-Database 
This comprehensive library database was created in fulfilment of my coursework at the University of Salford.

The database was meticulously designed to streamline the library's operations, enhance member experiences, and ensure data integrity. 

## Features

1. **Normalization**: The database is structured following the principles of normalization up to the third normal form (3NF), reducing redundancy and ensuring data consistency.

2. **Data Integrity**: The database also maintains data accuracy through various constraints, including primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints.

3. **Security**: Security is a top priority in the database, and member passwords are securely hashed and salted, preventing unauthorized access.

4. **Stored Procedures and Functions**: Custom-built procedures and functions were incorporated to simplify regular  tasks, such as member management and catalogue search.

5. **Triggers**: Automation triggers were also set up to perform actions, such as updating item status upon return, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.

6. **SQL Server Agent Jobs**: Agent jobs were scheduled to handle important daily tasks and streamline library operations.

## Usage Instructions
This database system is adaptable and can be customized to meet the unique needs of any library. It is a solid foundation for efficient library management and member engagement.
