# Library Database 
This library database was redesigned and developed in fulfilment of my coursework at the University of Salford using T-SQL statements in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

The database was meticulously redesigned to streamline the library's operations, enhance member experiences, and ensure data integrity. 

## Features

1. **Normalization**: The database is structured following the principles of normalization up to the third normal form (3NF), reducing redundancy and ensuring data consistency.

2. **Data Integrity**: The database also maintains data accuracy through various constraints, including primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints.

3. **Security**: Security is a top priority in the database, and member passwords are securely hashed and salted, preventing unauthorized access.

4. **Stored Procedures and Functions**: Custom-built procedures and functions were incorporated to simplify regular  tasks, such as member management and catalogue search.

5. **Triggers**: Automation triggers were also set up to perform actions, such as updating item status upon return, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.

6. **SQL Server Agent Jobs**: Agent jobs were scheduled to automate important daily tasks and streamline library operations.
